      "title": "What is a Reverse Proxy Server ",
      "body": " A reverse proxy sits between a user’s device and one or more backend servers. Unlike a standard (or forward) proxy server, which is typically used to access online resources by a user, a reverse proxy server manages inbound traffic and protects backend servers from direct access.Reverse proxy servers are useful for load balancing, SSL/TLS termination, content caching, and more. They can also provide an additional layer of security by hiding the IP addresses of backend servers and protecting them from common web attacks, such as Distributed Denial of Service (DDoS).",
